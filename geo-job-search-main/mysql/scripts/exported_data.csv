We’ve already helped start over 150,000 companies, and we’re just getting started. Being a part of RBCx Ventures, we are a unique type of business. We chart our course developing the technology our clients need, delivering frequently and continually improving our applications and processes. At the same time, we have direct access to the technical resources, expertise and opportunities of one of the world’s leading financial institutions.

 We are looking for a talented individual and passionate team player to join the Ownr team as a Software Engineer 2. You’ll be playing a big part in building the next evolution of our platform as we move to provide extensive new capabilities to business owners, working alongside a close-knit group of fun and ambitious engineers, product managers and designers. Your experience will contribute to the functionality, reliability, and delivery of our fast-moving Node/React-based application, leveraging the latest JavaScript-based tooling and best practices.

 The Opportunity

 You’ll have a clear view of the product roadmap, the business’ long-term vision, and the opportunity to constructively contribute to both.

 Web client: React, Styled Components
 Web server: Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express
 DB: PostgreSQL
 Infrastructure: Heroku and AWS (services include: RabbitMQ, Redis, s3, etc.)
 CI/CD: CircleCI and Github Actions
 Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress



 About you

 You have have 2+ years experience using JavaScript to build real world applications, preferably public facing.

 You have experience building, monitoring and maintaining software that is highly available, scalable, and resilient.
 You’ll take responsibility for finding opportunities to iteratively improve our technology in any feature you work on, paying down technical debt as a habit
 You’ll put in the work necessary to empathize with the software’s users and understand their challenges, whether those users are fellow developers, immediate team members, or the entrepreneurs that rely on us to support their business.
 You’re curious, and naturally invest energy into learning new technologies, techniques, and interpersonal skills that you feel help improve your own productivity and happiness, and the productivity and happiness of those around you.
 You have excellent spoken and written communication, time management, and project management abilities. You behave proactively to set expectations and find support when you recognize that there are unforeseen challenges or complexity in projects. 
You are comfortable asking questions and speaking up to help us continuously improve how we do things.


 What’s in it for you?
 We thrive on the challenge to be our best and work together to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. Here is what you can expect if you join our team:

 Job Description





































 Ownr is on an ambitious mission to help Canadian entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses. We are building a platform that takes the difficulty out of registering and maintaining sole proprietorships and corporations, letting our incredible business owners save time and money to focus on what matters - building their business. We’ve already helped start over 150,000 companies, and we’re just getting started. Being a part of RBCx Ventures, we are a unique type of business. We chart our course developing the technology our clients need, delivering frequently and continually improving our applications and processes. At the same time, we have direct access to the technical resources, expertise and opportunities of one of the world’s leading financial institutions.

 We are looking for a talented individual and passionate team player to join the Ownr team as a Software Engineer 2. You’ll be playing a big part in building the next evolution of our platform as we move to provide extensive new capabilities to business owners, working alongside a close-knit group of fun and ambitious engineers, product managers and designers. Your experience will contribute to the functionality, reliability, and delivery of our fast-moving Node/React-based application, leveraging the latest JavaScript-based tooling and best practices.

 The Opportunity

 You’ll have visibility into, and influence over, all parts of the technology stack, and enjoy a high degree of autonomy in your work.
 You’ll have a clear view of the product roadmap, the business’ long-term vision, and the opportunity to constructively contribute to both.
 You’ll contribute to the planning, design, development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of significant portions of the software that supports our users.
 You’ll have the chance to provide and receive feedback from your peers, and get coaching from more experienced engineers both within the team and the broader organization.
 You’ll use modern tooling throughout, whether that’s something currently part of our stack, or something new that you assess needs to be added to reliably deliver the desired user experience. A snapshot of what’s currently in-use:

 Web client: React, Styled Components
 Web server: Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express
 DB: PostgreSQL
 Infrastructure: Heroku and AWS (services include: RabbitMQ, Redis, s3, etc.)
 CI/CD: CircleCI and Github Actions
 Testing frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress



 About you

 You have have 2+ years experience using JavaScript to build real world applications, preferably public facing. You have a good understanding of development patterns and best practices and how they can impact your ability to be productive in a codebase and by extension, the maintainability of a platform.
 You have experience building, monitoring and maintaining software that is highly available, scalable, and resilient.
 You’ll take responsibility for finding opportunities to iteratively improve our technology in any feature you work on, paying down technical debt as a habit
 You’ll put in the work necessary to empathize with the software’s users and understand their challenges, whether those users are fellow developers, immediate team members, or the entrepreneurs that rely on us to support their business.
 You’re curious, and naturally invest energy into learning new technologies, techniques, and interpersonal skills that you feel help improve your own productivity and happiness, and the productivity and happiness of those around you.
 You have excellent spoken and written communication, time management, and project management abilities. You behave proactively to set expectations and find support when you recognize that there are unforeseen challenges or complexity in projects. 
You are comfortable asking questions and speaking up to help us continuously improve how we do things.


 What’s in it for you?
 We thrive on the challenge to be our best and work together to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. Here is what you can expect if you join our team:
